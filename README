This project was created by Ben Segal for use on a raspberry pi with 
sense hat. This project is depent on the sense library written by
Prof. Greg Silber.

What is this thing?
Ever played tick tack toe? Good you know the general idea.
Players take turns moving there color to the desired location
with the joy stick. When the player is satisfied with their
choice they tip the device on its side to place it and hand
off the control to the other player. When the game ends the
screen will display the victors color if there is one then
restart. To exit the game a player must "rage quit" by
flipping the device upside down.

Credit to Kaitlyn Neibert for inspiration, color pallet
and Tie graphics idea. Without her this project would not exist
